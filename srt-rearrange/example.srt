00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,600
It's Tuesday, April 8th, here's what's happening right now on CNN this morning.

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:13,200
I have great respect for China, but they can't do this.

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,760
President Trump threatens to escalate his trade war with China, issuing them an ultimatum

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,280
and a deadline.

5
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:26,600
The China does not appear to be backing down, plus our team will get to work tomorrow to

6
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:30,880
deport these heinous, violent foreign terrorists.

7
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:36,320
The White House can resume rapid deportations, but there's a catch, new rules from the

8
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,800
Supreme Court, also.

9
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:44,240
This is the highest I've seen the water in my lifetime.

10
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:50,000
The flooding danger is not over as deadly storms leave some communities under water.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,440
And in three short years, we got the University of Florida's basketball program back where

12
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,480
it belongs, which is winning national championships.

13
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,600
The Gators' Trump, Florida rallies past Houston to win the title, how they pulled off a comeback

14
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:14,640
in the final seconds.

15
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,520
It's 6am here on the east coast, here's a live look at Cincinnati, where communities around

16
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,600
the Ohio River could still see some more flooding threat today.

17
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,040
Good morning, everybody, I'm Audit Cornish, I want to thank you for waking up with me.

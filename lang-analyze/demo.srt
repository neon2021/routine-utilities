1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,000
You just said something that's like very important can't be dogmatic when you're talking about vaccines or about anything.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Yes it is good to keep an open mind isn't it and be flexible and look at a 360 degree view of things rather than your tunnel vision

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and what you're indoctrinated into isn't it?

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Yeah and especially if you know that indoctrination has been on purpose and profitable.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,000
One of the great things about your book is first of all your book is called dissolving illusions.

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I know I've talked about on the podcast a bunch of times but you also highlight a lot of things that we know are beneficial

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
that somehow or another get lumped into nonsense like even cinnamon.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 the joe rogan experience train by day joe rogan podcast by night all day

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 what's up what's up man good to see you good to see you uh so i guess we just get right into it

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 the last case that we talked about we had a very unfortunate incident happen after the podcast

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 about a month later yeah uh the gentleman beheaded somebody allegedly yes

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 allegedly there's a lot of allegedly's but yeah there's so many crazy things that case

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 the craziest thing was him uh trying to fool the security cameras with a wig

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 like i guess he didn't know how high resolution cameras had gotten over the 25 years that he was

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 in jail i mean apparently there's a lot he didn't know the only reason

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 i say allegedly is because um i'd be a bit of a hypocrite if i started calling him guilty um

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 before he has a trial but of course based on the surveillance um it doesn't look good
